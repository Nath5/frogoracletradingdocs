## Data Updates

The levels for this indicator are recalculated every night and published into TV each morning around 7am. You do not need to do anything to get these updates they should automatically appear on your chart.

## Types of Lines

By default there are 4 types of levels represented on the chart. These can be turned off and on individually in the settings. For example, if you don't want to see the POC because you are already using another volume profile indicator,  you could disable that type from the settings. Each type is defined below:

* <span style={{color: "#ce7feb"}}>■</span> **Price Derived S/R ( P ):** These lines are derived from pivot points in the raw price data run through the S/R algorithm. 

* <span style={{color: "#0398fc"}}>■</span> **Volume Derived S/R ( V ):** These lines are derived by using  intra-day volume to identify points of control. These daily areas of increased activity are then used to identify critical levels over the requested timeframe.

* <span style={{color: "#c6c2a7"}}>■</span> **Point of Control ( POC ):** This range represents where the majority of intra-day volume occurred over the requested timeframe.

* <span style={{color: "#fead6c"}}>■</span> **Developing Point of Control ( DPOC ):** This level is derived from the last 1+ days of volume data in realtime and shows where the most shares have been traded..

* <span style={{color: "#5bf09c"}}>■</span> **Gap ( G ):** These ranges show areas of gaps in the price action which often act as magnets. Gaps like to be closed.

* <span style={{color: "#f06292"}}>■</span> **Psychological ( M ):** Disabled By Default. These levels are typically nice round increments that traders flock to. As such they often act as areas of support and resistance.

* <span style={{color: "#62f0e4"}}>■</span> **Previous Day ( PD ):** Displays the previous days High, Low and Close on the chart and table.

* <span style={{color: "#62f0e4"}}>■</span> **Pre-Market ( PM ):** Displays the pre-market High, Low and Close on the chart and table.

## Updating The Indicator

The indicator receives frequent updates to fix bugs, optimize performance, and add new features. TradingView will send out an email each time an update is released.  The indicator on your chart will not automatically update. To apply the update, remove the indicator using the X as seen in the picture, restart TV / refresh the webpage, and then add the indicator back the same as you did the first time.  You will need to reconfigure your settings so take note of them before you update.

At the bottom right of your chart there is a version string. You can check that version against what is listed here on the website to ensure you are running the latest version.

> CURRENT VERSION: 2.1.4
