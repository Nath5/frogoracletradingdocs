# Overview

## Introduction

Each stock has its own personality and the indicator is designed to be flexible, allowing you tune it for each chart. Learning when and how to adjust these settings can make a large impact in your success leveraging the indicator.

## Data Updates

The levels are recalculated every night and published into TV / Portal each morning around 7am. You do not need to do anything to get these updates they should automatically appear on your chart.

## Portal vs TradingView Indicator

FrogOracle is available in two formats:

1. **Trading Portal** (this documentation): A standalone web application with comprehensive features
2. **TradingView Indicator**: A custom indicator that can be added to TradingView charts

## Types of Lines

By default there are 4 types of levels represented on the chart. These can be turned off and on individually in the settings. For example, if you don't want to see the POC because you are already using another volume profile indicator,  you could disable that type from the settings. Each type is defined below:

* <span style={{color: "#ce7feb"}}>■</span> **Price Derived S/R ( P ):** These lines are derived from pivot points in the raw price data run through the S/R algorithm. 

* <span style={{color: "#0398fc"}}>■</span> **Volume Derived S/R ( V ):** These lines are derived by using  intra-day volume to identify points of control. These daily areas of increased activity are then used to identify critical levels over the requested timeframe.

* <span style={{color: "#c6c2a7"}}>■</span> **Point of Control ( POC ):** This range represents where the majority of intra-day volume occurred over the requested timeframe.

* <span style={{color: "#fead6c"}}>■</span> **Developing Point of Control ( DPOC ):** This level is derived from the last 1+ days of volume data in realtime and shows where the most shares have been traded.

* <span style={{color: "#5bf09c"}}>■</span> **Gap ( G ):** These ranges show areas of gaps in the price action which often act as magnets. Gaps like to be closed.

* <span style={{color: "#f06292"}}>■</span> **Psychological ( M ):** Disabled By Default. These levels are typically nice round increments that traders flock to. As such they often act as areas of support and resistance.

* <span style={{color: "#62f0e4"}}>■</span> **Previous Day ( PD ):** Displays the previous days High, Low and Close on the chart and table.

* <span style={{color: "#62f0e4"}}>■</span> **Pre-Market ( PM ):** Displays the pre-market High, Low and Close on the chart and table.
