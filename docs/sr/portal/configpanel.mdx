# Configuration Panel

The Configuration panel allows you to customize the chart display and S/R level settings. Most of these settings are syncronized with your account and will persist across sessions and different devices.

1. Click the gear icon in the sidebar
2. The Configuration panel has two tabs:
   - **Settings**: Control visibility and behavior of S/R levels
   - **Look and Feel**: Customize colors for different level types

#### Settings Tab

- **Show Levels**: Toggle visibility of all S/R levels
- **Show Labels**: Toggle visibility of level labels
- **Merge Threshold**: Adjust how closely spaced levels are merged (0.1-10%)
- **Time Periods**: Toggle visibility of different analysis periods (90d, 120d, 180d, 240d, 360d)
- **Level Types**: Toggle visibility of different level types:
  - Core Level Types (P, V, G, POC)
  - Previous Day OHLC (PDO, PDH, PDL, PDC)
  - Mental Levels

#### Number of Levels

Control how many mental levels are displayed above and below the current price. The default is 3 levels in each direction.

#### Interval Settings

Mental levels use different interval spacing based on the price range of the asset:

- **Less than 1**: For low-priced assets (default: 0.1)
- **1-10**: For assets priced between $1-$10 (default: 0.5)
- **10-100**: For assets priced between $10-$100 (default: 1)
- **100-1000**: For assets priced between $100-$1000 (default: 5)
- **Above 1000**: For assets priced above $1000 (default: 10)

These intervals determine the spacing between mental levels. For example, with the default settings, a stock trading at $50 would show mental levels at $47, $48, $49, $51, $52, and $53.

### Using Mental Levels

Mental levels are particularly useful for:

- Identifying potential reversal points at round numbers
- Setting stop-loss or take-profit levels
- Understanding where other traders might have placed orders
- Complementing algorithmically detected support/resistance levels

#### Look and Feel Tab

- **Level Colors**: Customize colors for each level type
- **Candlestick Colors**: Customize colors for bullish and bearish candlesticks
