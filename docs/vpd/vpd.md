# Overview

## Introduction

:::warning
This indicator is currently only available on TradingView and is not available on the Web Portal.
:::

The volume profile indicator is designed to show what areas within a price range had the most shares exchanged. The goal with the FrogOracle version is to leverage the smallest lower time frame possible to ensure the best resolution and most accurate data.  The indicator will automatically scale the underlying lower time frame based on how large a period of time is being analyzed. Areas of high volume or volume shelves will often act as support / resistance levels.

## Premium Only Feature

:::info
In the settings there is a check box to use seconds based granularity. While this greatly improves the resolution of the volume profile, it is only available to Premium TradingView subscribers. The tool will still work well without enabling that feature so don't worry if you are on a lower TV plan.
